    <h1>Shopping Mall management using SpringBoot and frontend angular</h1>
    <p>A Shopping Mall Management System using Spring Boot and Angular typically <br>
        involves creating a web application that manages various aspects of a shopping mall, such as inventory, <br>
        customer orders, and user interactions. The backend is developed with Spring Boot to handle RESTful APIs, <br>
        while Angular is used for the frontend to provide a dynamic user interface. Key Features of the Shopping Mall Management System <br>

        User Management: <br>
        
        Allows for the registration, updating, and deletion of user accounts. <br>
        Admin users can manage roles and permissions. <br>
        Product Management: <br>
        
        Admins can add, update, and delete products in the inventory. <br>
        Each product can have details such as name, description, price, and stock quantity. <br>
        Order Management: <br>
        
        Customers can place orders for products. <br>
        Admins can view and manage all orders, including order status updates. <br>
        Customer Management: <br>
        
        Track customer information and order history. <br>
        Ability to manage customer feedback and support requests. <br>
        Reporting: <br>
        
        Generate reports on sales, inventory levels, and customer activity. <br>
        Use tools like Jasper Reports for generating PDF reports. <br>
        Technology Stack
        
        Backend: <br>
        
        Spring Boot: For building RESTful APIs and managing business logic. <br>
        MySQL: For relational database management to store user, product, and order data. <br>

        Development Process <br>
        
        Set Up Spring Boot Project: <br>
        
        Use Spring Initializr to create a new project with necessary dependencies. <br>
        Create RESTful APIs: <br>
        
        Develop controllers, services, and repositories to handle CRUD operations. <br>
        Set Up Angular Application: <br>
        
        Use Angular CLI to create a new project and set up routing. <br>
        Connect Frontend and Backend: <br>
        
        Use Angular's HttpClient to make API calls to the Spring Boot backend. <br>
        Testing and Deployment:
        <br>
        Test the application thoroughly and deploy it on a server or cloud platform. <br>
        This system provides a comprehensive solution for managing a shopping mall's operations <br> efficiently, enhancing both customer experience and administrative control..</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Prerequisites <br>
        Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine: <br>
        
        Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 11 or higher. <br>
        Maven: For managing Java dependencies. <br>
        Node.js and npm: For managing Angular dependencies. <br>
        MySQL: For the database (or any other database you choose). <br>
        Angular CLI: For creating and managing Angular applications. <br>
        Step 1: Clone the Repository <br>
        Open your terminal or command prompt.
        
        Clone the project repository using the following command:
        
        bash
        Copy code
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopping-mall-management.git
        Navigate into the project directory:
        
        bash
        Copy code
        cd shopping-mall-management
        Step 2: Set Up the Backend (Spring Boot)
        Navigate to the Backend Directory:
        
        bash
        Copy code
        cd backend
        Configure Database Connection:
        
        Open the application.properties file located in src/main/resources.
        Update the database connection settings:
        properties
        Copy code
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
        spring.datasource.username=your_username
        spring.datasource.password=your_password
        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
        Build the Backend:
        
        Use Maven to build the project:
        bash
        Copy code
        mvn clean install
        Run the Spring Boot Application:
        
        Start the application using the following command:
        bash
        Copy code
        mvn spring-boot:run
        The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:8080.
        Step 3: Set Up the Frontend (Angular)
        Navigate to the Frontend Directory:
        
        bash
        Copy code
        cd ../frontend
        Install Dependencies:
        
        Install the required npm packages:
        bash
        Copy code
        npm install
        Configure API Endpoint:
        
        Open the environment configuration file located at src/environments/environment.ts.
        Update the API URL to point to your backend:
        typescript
        Copy code
        export const environment = {
          production: false,
          apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8080/api' // Adjust as necessary
        };
        Run the Angular Application:
        
        Start the Angular development server:
        bash
        Copy code
        ng serve
        The frontend application should now be running on http://localhost:4200.
        Step 4: Access the Application
        Open your web browser.
        Navigate to http://localhost:4200 to access the Angular frontend.
        You can now register a new user, log in, and explore the features of the Shopping Mall Management System.
        Step 5: Database Initialization (Optional)
        If your application includes initial data (like sample products or users), you may need to run a script or use a SQL file to populate your database. Check the src/main/resources directory for any SQL files that may be included.
        Step 6: Testing the Application
        Test the various features of the application, including user registration, product browsing, order placement, and admin functionalities.
        Step 7: Building for Production (Optional)
        To build the Angular application for production, run:
        bash
        Copy code
        ng build --prod
        This will create a dist folder containing the production-ready files. You can serve these files using a web server or integrate them into your Spring Boot application.</p>
